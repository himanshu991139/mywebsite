                            Our tutors are thoroughly evaluated for their personal identity, academic and teaching
                            experience. We Judge the tutors on their merits alone. We believe in Quality of Teaching
                            which differentiates us from others. That is why, we say: Beyond Tutoring.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            We undertake each and every assignment with equal amount of sincerity whether it is small
                            (teaching 1st class student) or big assignment (training for Competitions - IIT, PMT etc.)
                            .We personally match our best tutor to your teaching assignment before suggesting you the
                            same. We Offer one hour free demo session* to let you yourself evaluate our tutor (* - Free
                            demo session of 1 hour will be charged if you satisfied and you decide to continue with the
                            same tutor and will not be charged if your child is not satisfied). If, for whatever reason,
                            your tutor doesn't meet your requirements, we'll provide you another one.

                        <h4>Your first lesson</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>We always recommend learning in a quiet environment so that tutor and tutee can work without
                            disturbance.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It is helpful to consider exactly what you want to achieve from your lessons, and to explain
                            this to the tutor. The tutor may want to talk through your motivation for studying the
                            subject in question, and may do some exercises with you to ascertain your skill level so far
                            - don't be bashful, you're not supposed to be able to be an Einstein yet!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ultimately, the first lesson is an opportunity to gauge your rapport with the tutor and their
                            teaching style. Don't be afraid to ask your tutor to raise or ease the pace or difficulty of
                            lessons; equally, if you would like to change anything about the lessons (direction,
                            structure, etc) just mention it to your tutor.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>As your Tutorial Sessions Progress</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>If you would like to change anything about the sessions (content, structure) just mention it to your tutor.</p>
